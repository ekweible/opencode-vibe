# @opencode/react (future package)

**React bindings for OpenCode.**

This folder will be extracted to `packages/react` when patterns stabilize.

## Purpose

- React hooks (`useSession`, `useMessages`, `useSSE`, `useProvider`)
- Context providers (`<OpencodeProvider>`)
- React-specific integration layer
- Server Actions for SDK calls
- Reusable across any React app (web, desktop)

## Extraction Trigger

Extract to `packages/react` after **third use** of a pattern.

Wait for patterns to emerge organically - premature abstraction is worse than duplication.
